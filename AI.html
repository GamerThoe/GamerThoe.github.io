    <h3>To BAN or not to BAN </h3>
    <p>Now that AI is here, what do we do as educators?  Should we block it out, ban it from our classrooms, and hope to teach our students to <b>Just Say No</b>?  Though currently RUSD has <b>NOT</b> elected to <b>BAN</b>
    the technology, they have removed the ability for students to log in using their google suite accounts.  There are growing sentiments among my colleagues to remove the technology (like ChatGPT) from the classroom, something that I
    disagree with completely.  If you are interested how I am adapting to this technology in my classroom, here are some key points to consider: </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Students who have access to ChatGPT will use it at home</li>
      <li>Students who <b>DO NOT</b> have access to ChatGPT at home will be at a disadvantage -- this is not <b>equitable</b></li>
      <li>Assignments that can be done eaily with ChatGPT are most likely <b>not</b> rigorous assignments</li>
      <li>Students know the difference between <b>right</b> and <b>wrong</b></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Benefits of AI</h3>
    <p>Aside from the points above, what about all the <b>benefits</b> AI has to offer in the classroom? </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Individual Tutor for <b>every</b> student</li>
      <li>A tool to help students learn to <i>articulate</i> what they are looking for or need help with</li>
      <li>The chance to teach students how to use AI tools <i>responsibly</i></li>
      <li>The ability for AI to remember and adapt to the needs and previous student inquiries</li>
      <li>Arming students with the newest tools in tech available</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3> Action Research Plan </h3>
    <h4> December 12, 2024 </h4>
    <p> During my time working on my Masters of Education in STEM, I developed an Action Research Plan for the topic of AI in Schools
      to be conducted where I work, <b>Redlands Unified School District</b>.  This plan has not yet been implemented, but if you are interested
      in conducting your own Action Research in your area, you might find this beneficial.  I have included both the presentation I gave
      as well as the presentation itself for anyone who might want to make a copy of it for their own use.  Feel free to use it or part
      of it!<br>
       <a = href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kyh6WnCLjUTvG-HqQmMXSs7Rjlmbn3yyKMCVtoATKQg/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slides</a>
    </p>

    
    <h3> Conclusion </h3>
    <p>I'm of the opinion that this technology is <b>here to stay</b>.  Rather than pretend we can actually stop students from
    using it, for those people who wish that was possible, I believe it is imperative to teach students how to use it <i>responsibly</i>.
    Nobody knows for sure what will come of AI or if it will take over our world (in education or in general) but there are benefits to 
    using this technology now and adapting to a world with AI is something we can do.  As educators we have a duty to prepare our students for
    the future and how to use things like ChatGPT ethically.  The world <i>has</i> changed, and it is important that we change too.
